# MRI_converter
Convert enhanced multiframe MRI to standard DICOM format using drag and drop GUI

This tool converts enhanced multi-frame DICOM MRIs into standard single-frame DICOM files that can be viewed in most DICOM viewers. Each image sequence is saved in its own folder and named for the patient and sequence type (e.g., SPGR, T2, DWI).
